The Thread That Holds

Consistency, a silent thread, Woven through the days we've led. Not loud like storms or bold like flame, But steady as the morning's name.

It walks with us in quiet pace, A rhythm time cannot erase. Through triumphs bright and trials deep, It guards the promises we keep.

Not born of ease or fleeting thrill, But forged in choice, in patient will. A whisper in the face of doubt, That says, “Hold on, don’t count me out.”

It builds the bridge from dream to done, One brick, one breath, beneath the sun. And when the world begins to sway, Consistency will light the way.
